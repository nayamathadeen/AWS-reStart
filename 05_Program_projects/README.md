### 📁 Project 1: Scalable AWS Architecture for a 3D E-Commerce Platform

## Introduction
This project focuses on designing a highly available, scalable, and cost-efficient AWS architecture for a next-generation 3D e-commerce platform. The core challenge was supporting high-fidelity 3D model interaction while maintaining fast load times and reliability for a global user base.

Rather than deploying a simple web stack, I approached this project as a real-world cloud architecture problem, prioritizing performance, fault tolerance, and elasticity from day one.

## Project Summary
I designed a multi-tier AWS architecture capable of handling traffic spikes, large asset delivery, and dynamic backend workloads. The solution uses managed AWS services to reduce operational overhead while ensuring scalability and security.

Key architectural outcomes include:
- Global content delivery using Amazon CloudFront for low-latency access to 3D assets
- Elastic backend services that automatically scale based on demand
- A hybrid database strategy combining relational and NoSQL databases for performance and consistency
- Built-in monitoring, security, and queue-based decoupling for reliability

This project demonstrates my ability to translate business requirements into technical architecture decisions, evaluate trade-offs, and design cloud systems aligned with AWS best practices.

### 📁 Project 2: AWS-Based Cloud Automation & Service Integration

## Introduction
This project explores hands-on AWS service integration and automation, focusing on how different AWS components work together to support modern, event-driven applications. The goal was to move beyond theory and build practical workflows using core AWS services.

I treated this project as a learning environment to strengthen my understanding of compute, storage, databases, security, and monitoring in a cloud-native context.

## Project Summary
I implemented and analyzed multiple AWS services working together to support application deployment, data handling, and operational visibility. Emphasis was placed on service selection, automation, and cost-aware design.

Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Launching and managing compute services such as EC2, Lambda, and App Runner
- Using S3 and databases for structured and unstructured data storage
- Applying IAM, security groups, and WAF to secure cloud resources
- Monitoring application health and performance using CloudWatch
- Understanding how decoupled architectures improve resilience and scalability

This project strengthened my ability to design, deploy, troubleshoot, and document cloud solutions, reinforcing foundational skills required for entry-level cloud and DevOps roles.
