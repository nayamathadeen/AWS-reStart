# Lab Summary: Python Prime Numbers Challenge (Linux)

This lab focused on using Python 3 in a Linux environment to generate all prime numbers between 1 and 250 and store the results in a text file. The challenge reinforced core Python programming concepts while also strengthening Linux command-line skills.

By completing this lab, a Python script was created, executed, and validated entirely from the Linux terminal, demonstrating how scripting and file management work together in real-world environments.

---

## Working in a Linux Environment

- Verified the working directory using the `pwd` command
- Confirmed Python 3 availability on the system
- Created and managed files using Linux terminal commands
- Used built-in Linux utilities to validate program output
- Identified the absolute path of the script

**Goal:** Build confidence using Linux for scripting and automation tasks.

---

## Writing the Prime Numbers Script

- Created a Python script named `prime_numbers.py`
- Implemented a function to determine whether a number is prime
- Used loops and conditional logic to evaluate numbers from 1 to 250
- Wrote all prime numbers to a file named `results.txt`
- Printed a confirmation message upon successful execution

**Goal:** Apply Python fundamentals to solve an algorithmic problem.

---

## Verifying and Validating Output

- Executed the script using Python 3
- Verified output file creation
- Displayed file contents to confirm correctness
- Counted the total number of primes using Linux tools
- Confirmed the script’s absolute file path

**Goal:** Ensure accuracy, persistence, and correctness of program output.

## Key Lessons Learned
- Python scripts can be created and executed entirely from the Linux terminal
- Functions improve code clarity and reusability
- File handling enables programs to store persistent results
- Linux commands are essential for validating program behavior
- Verifying output is a critical part of programming workflows

## Final Summary
This lab provided hands-on experience with:

- Python scripting in a Linux environment
- Algorithmic problem solving using loops and conditionals
- Writing output to files
- Using Linux commands to validate and troubleshoot scripts
- Managing files and paths in a cloud-based system

These skills form a strong foundation for automation, scripting, and backend development in Linux and cloud environments.
