# Lab Summary: Creating a Hello, World Program

This lab introduced the fundamentals of programming using the Python programming language. The focus of the lab was to become familiar with the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE), understand basic Python concepts, and write a simple program to verify that the development environment was set up correctly.

By creating and running a Hello, World program, this lab demonstrated how Python code is written, saved, and executed within a cloud-based development environment.

## Working with the AWS Cloud9 IDE

- Accessed the AWS Management Console and launched the Cloud9 IDE
- Opened a preconfigured Cloud9 environment
- Navigated the IDE interface, including the file explorer and terminal
- Verified the working directory for project files

**Goal:** Become familiar with a cloud-based coding environment.

---

## Understanding Python Basics

- Learned what Python is and how it is used
- Reviewed differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x
- Identified Python as a high-level, general-purpose programming language
- Confirmed the installed Python versions using terminal commands

**Goal:** Understand the Python runtime environment used for programming labs.

---

## Writing and Running the First Python Program

- Created a new Python file using a template
- Removed default template code
- Wrote a simple `print()` statement
- Saved and executed the program using the Run button
- Verified successful output in the terminal pane

**Goal:** Successfully write and execute a Python program.

## Key Lessons Learned
- Python is a high-level programming language that uses readable syntax
- AWS Cloud9 provides a fully managed, browser-based development environment
- Python files use the `.py` extension
- Programs can be executed directly from the IDE
- Terminal commands help verify environment configuration

---

## Final Summary
This lab provided hands-on experience with:

- Navigating the AWS Cloud9 IDE
- Understanding Python versions and environments
- Writing and executing a basic Python program
- Verifying development tool setup

These foundational skills are essential for learning programming, automation, and scripting in cloud and development environments.
